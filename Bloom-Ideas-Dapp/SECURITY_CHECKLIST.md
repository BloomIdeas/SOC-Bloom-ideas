# Security Checklist for NFT Deployment

## ✅ Environment Files Protection

### .gitignore Configuration
- [x] `.env*` patterns in root .gitignore
- [x] Hardhat-specific files in .gitignore
- [x] Contracts-specific .gitignore created
- [x] Private key files excluded

### Files Currently Protected
- [x] `.env` files (all variations)
- [x] `cache/` directory
- [x] `artifacts/` directory  
- [x] `typechain-types/` directory
- [x] `coverage/` directory
- [x] Private key files (`*.pem`, `*.key`)

## 🔒 Deployment Security

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Use a dedicated wallet for deployment
- [ ] Never commit private keys
- [ ] Test on testnet first
- [ ] Verify contract address after deployment

### Environment Variables to Set
```env
# In contracts/.env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
ETHERLINK_RPC_URL=https://node.ghostnet.etherlink.com
ETHERLINK_EXPLORER_URL=https://testnet.explorer.etherlink.com

# In root .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

## 🛡️ Contract Security Features

### Access Control
- [x] Only owner can mint NFTs
- [x] Input validation for all parameters
- [x] Safe math operations
- [x] Proper error handling

### Data Protection
- [x] On-chain metadata storage
- [x] No external dependencies for metadata
- [x] Immutable contract logic

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Contract
- [x] Contract compiled successfully
- [x] Tests pass (when fixed)
- [x] Gas optimization implemented
- [x] Security features in place

### Frontend
- [x] NFT service implemented
- [x] Error handling complete
- [x] Loading states implemented
- [x] User feedback mechanisms

### Documentation
- [x] Deployment guide created
- [x] Security checklist created
- [x] Environment setup documented

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key" > .env
   echo "ETHERLINK_RPC_URL=https://node.ghostnet.etherlink.com" >> .env
   ```

2. **Deploy contract**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network etherlinkTestnet
   ```

3. **Update frontend environment**
   ```bash
   # In root directory
   echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_address" >> .env.local
   ```

4. **Test the integration**
   - Submit an idea
   - Verify NFT minting
   - Check NFT display in profile

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Contract deployed successfully
- [ ] Contract address saved
- [ ] Frontend environment updated
- [ ] NFT minting works
- [ ] NFT gallery displays correctly
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

## ⚠️ Security Reminders

- **Never commit .env files**
- **Use dedicated deployment wallet**
- **Test thoroughly on testnet**
- **Keep private keys secure**
- **Monitor contract interactions**

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify environment variables
3. Ensure wallet is connected to correct network
4. Check contract deployment status
